<h2>Summmary</h2>
<p>
The aim of this app is provide to undiagnosed patients a tool for recording: symptoms, intakes, wearables measures, medical files...
</p>
<p>
Using open technology, including smart phone apps, wearables (such as watches) and a dedicated website,
My Health, will let patients and their carers manage health data integrated with other sources of open data to help
them identify, monitor and track their own disease progression on a day-to-day basis, collaborating with
clinicians and researchers to find new ways to fight diseases.
</p>
<p>
My Health will be configured as a collaboration platform for data-driven health management. Open data covering
different aspects of biomedicine (drugs, side effects, genetics, etc) will be integrated using biomedical ontologies
giving the platform self-reasoning capabilities, so that new actionable knowledge can be inferred and decision
can be taken.
